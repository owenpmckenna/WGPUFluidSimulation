# This is a small project testing out WGPU in Rust
I was mainly inspired by several [SebastianLague](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague) videos, and figured out how to make this work with [this wgpu example](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/blob/trunk/examples/src/hello_compute) and [this very helpful tutorial](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/) for the most part. I plan to make this a decent fluid simulator so I can figure out how GPU programming works, mostly. Feel free to use whatever you want from here, there's a serious lack of information online (compared to other technologies) on WGPU+Rust usage. In particular this codebase generates data in rust, runs compute shaders on it, and renders it (also using shaders).
